    "Overview: You are tasked with:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 1. Simulating the Gosper Glider gun from Conway's game of life\n",
    " - 2. Introducing a 'spaceship' specie into the simulation and 'assessing' the disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the example given in class, we can break this exercise down into a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Initialise a 2D 'Universe' which we will run our simulation over\n",
    " - Define the shape and location of species for the Gosper glider simulation\n",
    " - Introduce a new specie into the simulation\n",
    " - Consider a time of simulation\n",

    "<b>Please note:</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss this in class, but aside from a working notebook we are also looking for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - An associated narrative with each operation, \n",
    " - Comments in the code boxes using the # symbol\n",
    " - A brief summary of results\n",
    " - A list of any references used\n",
    " \n",
    "Also please note that to add another code or markdown box, you can simple use the 'Insert' option on the main menu.\n",
